# ITI107 Practical Assignment 

## Introduction 

Object Detection has many useful applications, such as autonomous vehicles, crowd sensing, video surveillance and many more. You have learnt how to train a custom object detector in your practical exercise using Tensorflow Object Detection API. It is time to apply what you have learnt to create your own custom detector.

## Tasks

You are to form a **team of 2** to work on this assignment. 

For this assignment, you are expected to identify what objects you would like to detect (2 classes of objects) and train a custom detector for the identified objects. The following are the suggested workflow you will need to complete:

- Collect and annotate the images
- Decide on the object detection algorithm you would like to use
- Define the training pipeline in TFOD 
- Train the model and evaluate the model accuracy
- Export your model for inference
- Test your inference model on image and video 

You are required to produce a video clip (1 to 2 minutes) that showcase your object detector in action.

## Marking 

The assignment constitutes 50% of your total marks for this module. 

Your will be assessed on the following: 

- understanding of the data collection and data annotation process 
- understanding of the training and evaluation process
- reasonable accuracy of the object detection

**Note:** This is not a competition, so we are NOT awarding marks based on your ranking in accuracy. However, we do expect certain 'acceptable' level of accuracy, that makes the detector useful.


## Submission

You are to submit the following: 

1. Report (Maximum 2 pages) that contains the following: 
   - discussion of your data collection and annotation process
   - discussion of training/validation process (e.g train/dev split, overfitting, hyper-parameter tuning)
   - screenshots of mAP and loss and evaluation images from Tensorboard 
2. Training pipleline config file and labelmap file
3. Video file (.mp4) with object detecions. 


Submission deadline: 20 Dec 2020 1159PM.
